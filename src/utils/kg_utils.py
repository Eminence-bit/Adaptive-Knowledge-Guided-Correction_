    """
    Retrieve facts for a query from Wikipedia and persist the results in a local cache.
    
    Attempts to fetch a short summary and description for the query from the Wikipedia REST API. If the remote fetch fails or returns a non-200 status, the function uses predefined hardcoded facts as a fallback. In all cases the resulting list of fact strings is saved to the JSON cache at `cache_path` and returned.
    
    Parameters:
        query (str): The entity or topic to look up.
        cache_path (str): Path to a JSON file used to read/write cached query results. Defaults to "models/cache/kg_cache.json".
    
    Returns:
        list: A list of fact strings for the query; may include a truncated Wikipedia extract, a "Description: ..." line, and/or hardcoded fallback facts.
