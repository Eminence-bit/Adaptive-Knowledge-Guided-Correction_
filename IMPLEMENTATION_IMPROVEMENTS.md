# AKGC Implementation Improvements

## Overview
This document details the improvements made to the Adaptive Knowledge-Guided Correction (AKGC) framework to fix critical bugs and enhance performance.

## Critical Bugs Fixed

### 1. Merge Conflict Resolution (`src/utils/kg_utils.py`)
**Problem:** Git merge conflicts left in the codebase prevented module imports.
**Solution:** Resolved conflicts by combining the best features from both branches:
- Kept comprehensive docstrings
- Maintained Wikipedia API integration with error handling
- Preserved hardcoded fact database as fallback
- Ensured proper caching mechanism

### 2. Undefined Variables (`src/akgc_algorithm.py`)
**Problem:** Variables `entity` and `kg_facts` were used before being defined in `adaptive_correction()`.
**Solution:** 
- Added proper entity extraction before KG fact fetching
- Ensured variables are initialized before use
- Added fallback logic for missing facts

### 3. Package Compatibility (`requirements.txt`)
**Problem:** Hardcoded package versions incompatible with Python 3.12.
**Solution:** Updated to flexible version constraints (>=) for all dependencies.

## Algorithm Enhancements

### 1. Entity Extraction Improvements

**Previous Issues:**
- "World War II" extracted as "Ii Ended In"
- "The sun rises" extracted as "The"
- Poor handling of multi-word entities

**Improvements:**
```python
# Special pattern matching for complex entities
special_patterns = [
    r"World War (I{1,3}|[12])",  # Handles WWI, WWII, etc.
    r"(Napoleon Bonaparte|Julius Caesar|...)",  # Famous figures
]

# Astronomy-specific patterns
astro_patterns = [
    r"(?:the\s+)?sun\s+rises",  # Detects sun context
    r"(?:the\s+)?moon\s+(?:is|orbits)",  # Detects moon context
]

# Science patterns with atomic numbers
science_patterns = [
    r"([A-Z][a-z]+)\s+(?:is|has)\s+atomic\s+number",
    r"([A-Z][a-z]+)\s+is\s+made\s+of",
]
```

**Results:**
| Input | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| "World War II ended in 1945" | "Ii Ended In" | "World War II" |
| "The sun rises in the east" | "The" | "Sun" |
| "Oxygen has atomic number 8" | "Oxygen" | "Oxygen" ✓ |
| "Napoleon was born in Corsica" | "Napoleon" | "Napoleon Bonaparte" |

### 2. HVI (Hallucination Vulnerability Index) Optimization

**Previous Implementation:**
```python
kg_score = 1.0 if any(fact in output_text for fact in kg_facts) else 0.5
return 0.6 * similarity + 0.4 * kg_score
```

**Problems:**
- Binary scoring (1.0 or 0.5) - no granularity
- Required exact substring match
- Equal weight to exact and partial matches
- No handling of "not available" facts

**New Implementation:**
```python
# Compute knowledge grounding with partial matching
exact_matches = sum(1 for fact in valid_facts if fact.lower() in output_lower)
partial_scores = []

for fact in valid_facts:
    # Extract meaningful words (excluding stopwords)
    fact_words = extract_meaningful_words(fact)
    output_words = extract_meaningful_words(output_text)
    
    # Calculate overlap ratio
    overlap_ratio = len(fact_words & output_words) / len(fact_words)
    partial_scores.append(overlap_ratio)

# Weight exact matches more heavily
exact_score = min(exact_matches / len(valid_facts), 1.0)
partial_score = max(partial_scores) if partial_scores else 0.0

if partial_score > 0.5:
    kg_score = 0.5 * exact_score + 0.5 * partial_score
else:
    kg_score = 0.7 * exact_score + 0.3 * partial_score

# Emphasize knowledge grounding over similarity
return 0.4 * similarity + 0.6 * kg_score
```

**Benefits:**
- Granular scoring based on word overlap
- Handles partial matches intelligently
- Filters stopwords for better semantic matching
- Adapts weighting based on match quality
- Increases weight on KG grounding (60% vs 40%)

### 3. Contradiction Detection

**Problem:** System couldn't detect when response contained contradictory information:
- "The capital of India is Mumbai" (wrong) vs "The capital of India is New Delhi" (correct)
- High word overlap (67%) led to false acceptance

**Solution:**
```python
# Check for contradictions in entity information
for fact in kg_facts:
    fact_words = extract_meaningful_words(fact)
    overlap = len(response_words & fact_words)
    overlap_ratio = overlap / max(len(response_words), 1)
    
    # Detect contradictions
    fact_entities = fact_words - response_words
    response_entities = response_words - fact_words
    
    # Shared context but different entities = contradiction
    if overlap >= 2 and len(fact_entities) > 0 and len(response_entities) > 0:
        has_contradiction = True
    
    # Support only if high overlap AND no contradiction
    if overlap_ratio > 0.6 and not has_contradiction:
        kg_supports_response = True
```

**Example:**
```
Prompt: "The capital of India is Mumbai"
Fact: "The capital of India is New Delhi"

Response words: {mumbai, capital, india}
Fact words: {capital, india, new, delhi}
Overlap: 2 (capital, india)
Fact entities: {new, delhi}
Response entities: {mumbai}

Detection: Shared context (capital, india) with different entities (Mumbai ≠ New Delhi)
Result: Contradiction detected → Correction applied ✓
```

### 4. Enhanced Fact Selection

**Multi-Stage Selection Process:**

**Stage 1: Priority Keyword Matching**
```python
priority_keywords = {
    'capital': ['capital', 'city'],
    'element': ['element', 'atomic', 'chemical'],
    'war': ['war', 'battle', 'conflict'],
    'born': ['born', 'birth'],
    'ended': ['ended', 'finished'],
}
```

**Stage 2: Word Overlap Scoring**
```python
# Calculate semantic similarity
prompt_words = extract_meaningful_words(prompt)
for fact in kg_facts:
    fact_words = extract_meaningful_words(fact)
    overlap = len(prompt_words & fact_words)
    score = overlap / max(len(prompt_words), 1)
```

**Stage 3: Fallback Selection**
- Returns highest scoring fact
- Falls back to first valid fact if no strong matches

## Performance Improvements

### 1. Caching Layer
- **Location:** `self.kg_cache` in `OptimizedAKGC`
- **Benefit:** Avoids redundant API calls for same entities
- **File-based cache:** `models/cache/kg_cache.json`

### 2. Compiled Regex Patterns
```python
def compile_entity_patterns(self):
    """Compile patterns once for efficient reuse"""
    patterns = {
        'geo': [re.compile(r"capital of ([A-Za-z ]+?)...", re.IGNORECASE)],
        'science': [re.compile(r"element ([A-Za-z ]+)", re.IGNORECASE)],
        'history': [re.compile(r"war ([A-Za-z ]+)", re.IGNORECASE)]
    }
    return patterns
```

### 3. Stopword Filtering
- Reduces noise in semantic comparisons
- Focuses on meaningful content words
- Improves matching accuracy

## Testing Framework

### Component Tests (`test_akgc_logic.py`)
- KG utility functions
- Entity extraction
- Contextual fact generation
- Cache functionality

### Comprehensive Tests (`test_akgc_comprehensive.py`)
- End-to-end pipeline simulation
- Mock-based testing (no model downloads required)
- Validates correction logic
- Current pass rate: 50% (3/6 tests)

### Test Results
```
Test Case 1: "The capital of France is Florida" → PASSED ✓
Test Case 2: "Water is made of hydrogen and oxygen" → FAILED (false correction)
Test Case 3: "World War II ended in 1945" → FAILED (false correction)
Test Case 4: "The capital of India is Mumbai" → PASSED ✓
Test Case 5: "Oxygen has atomic number 8" → PASSED ✓
Test Case 6: "The sun rises in the west" → FAILED (missed correction)
```

## Known Limitations

### 1. Directional Contradictions
**Issue:** "sun rises in west" vs "sun sets in west" 
- Both contain "west" → high overlap
- Semantic difference not detected by word-level matching

**Potential Solution:** Position-aware semantic analysis

### 2. Complex Semantic Relationships
- Temporal relationships (before/after)
- Causal relationships (because/therefore)
- Negations (not, never)

### 3. Network Dependency
- Wikipedia API requires internet access
- Falls back to hardcoded facts when offline

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from src.akgc_algorithm import adaptive_correction, load_model, load_llm

# Load models
model, tokenizer = load_model("distilbert-base-uncased", device)
llm, llm_tokenizer = load_llm(device)

# Detect and correct hallucination
response, factual, hvi = adaptive_correction(
    model, tokenizer, llm, llm_tokenizer,
    "The capital of France is Florida.",
    device
)

print(f"Corrected: {response}")
# Output: "The capital of France is Paris."
print(f"Factual: {factual}")  
# Output: False
print(f"HVI: {hvi:.3f}")
# Output: 0.520
```

### Optimized Version
```python
from src.akgc_optimized import OptimizedAKGC

# Initialize once
akgc = OptimizedAKGC()

# Batch processing
test_prompts = [
    "The capital of France is Florida.",
    "Oxygen has atomic number 8.",
]

results = akgc.batch_process(test_prompts)
for result in results:
    print(f"Prompt: {result['prompt']}")
    print(f"Response: {result['response']}")
    print(f"Factual: {result['factual']}")
    print(f"HVI: {result['hvi']:.3f}\n")
```
